They use an innovative structure to do something no one has ever done before: Offer expert, high-quality legal advice to any American with a serious need — for free. Their initial focus is on navigation: They diagnose clients’ needs, explain their options, and help them find and hire the right specific lawyer (or nonprofit) to move forward. To lawyers, they operate as a broker: They send them pre-vetted clients, and earn a percentage of what they make from each successful representation.

Who are their clients? A sample to date: A woman harassed for refusing her boss’s advances. A child whose parent died without a will. A father disabled after being hit by a truck. An immigrant seeking to grow her family. Some of these folks are rural and low-income; others are wealthy and well-educated.

Dunn & Hillam Architects,6/8/16,certified,"Dunn & Hillam's aim is to produce honest, beautiful and practical architecture that is of an international standard, whilst being distinguishably Australian. They believe that architecture is an important tool in the creation of community, the way they interact with and create places, and the way people engage with each other. Dunn & Hillam Architects follow three basic principles in everything they do.
 
It's the people that matter: Great clients, great staff, great consultants and collaborators make great projects. Architecture is for people and should benefit those inside it and those around it.
 
Good design is sustainable design: A building doesn’t have to flag itself as sustainable. Dunn & Hillam believe in building smaller but better as the most important move towards sustainable architecture. Sustainability is always in environmental, economic and social terms.
 
Architecture is not a consumer object: Architecture should not become obsolete or out of fashion. It should work with the past and with the future to contribute to our cities, towns and landscapes in ways that are lasting and positive.

The solution? The ovens were rented at affordable rates which assisted young entrepreneurs to enter a booming market place. Later, Allan bought out his partner and devised a funding option that enabled small businesses to procure the equipment they needed, without committing large amounts of capital up-front. The new option, called Rent-Try-Buy , is a simple 12 month agreement where the customer rents the equipment, and if they wish to purchase the asset there is a 75% rental rebate off the purchase price.

Seeing that the American home delivery pizza market was booming, and convinced of the market's potential for growth in Australia, Allan English, Silver Chef's founder and Managing Director, and a business partner, invested heavily in conveyor ovens. Unfortunately, it soon became clear that many pizza businesses could not afford to buy them. 

The solution? The ovens were rented at affordable rates which assisted young entrepreneurs to enter a booming market place. Later, Allan bought out his partner and devised a funding option that enabled small businesses to procure the equipment they needed, without committing large amounts of capital up-front. The new option, called Rent-Try-Buy , is a simple 12 month agreement where the customer rents the equipment, and if they wish to purchase the asset there is a 75% rental rebate off the purchase price. This has been at the centre of the Silver Chef success story ever since.",Credit Provider,Financial Services,Provides flexible funding option to hospitality & commercial equipment markets.,Australia,Queensland,Brisbane,Service with Minor Environmental Footprint, 250-999,bcorporation.net/directory/silver-chef,silverchefgroup.com.au,2015,83.1,2,20.8,11,5.2,13.4,32.8,0.8,0,0,0,1.5,6,,,4.7,3.1,,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,3.5,,,,0.6,,,,,,,,2,1.6,1.1,2.5,6,,7.7,,3.2,2.7,,2.1,12,,3.3,

Physicians Thrive,9/23/18,certified,"Justin Nabity, Founder and CEO of Physicians Thrive discovered that physicians frequently get screwed over. This happens on a regular basis because of physicians' limited financial education due to the intensity and focus it takes to become a healthcare professional and because physicians suffer from high burnout and stress from the demands of work and family. His team set out to change this by providing them with a robust menu of services to support them while they make major financial and career decisions. 

After serving physicians for almost a decade it became clear that their primary role was to help physicians gain financial vision. Driven by a mission to do the most good possible for their clients, they decided to give back to the community by impacting physical vision and establishing a one-for-one program. With every client served, a person with cataract blindness would receive sight-restoring surgery. In order to create the platform to serve clients and restore sight to many, we formed Give Sight Global, a 501(c)3 to be the engine behind the movement to restore sight to one million eyes.
