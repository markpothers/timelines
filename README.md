# Timelines Readme

# Short Description

The Timelines web app is designed to compare users in the database with respect to the cities they live in and have visited on vacation. It's primary purpose is to compare these with other users in the database and look for overlaps where users have been in the same city at the same time.

Checking an individual's page provides a list of places they have lived in and travelled to. It also offers a list of other people who were in the same city at the same time, themselves either living there or on vacation.

The app has user login functionality to protect the users' data.
